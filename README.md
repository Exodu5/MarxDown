# Markdown editor with Parcel & React

## Getting started

Install deps:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

Then open `http://localhost:1234` and edit `index.js` and press save. Parcel
will automagically hot reload you files whenever you make changes.

## Building for Production

```
npm run build
```

This will compile your JS and copy your `index.html` to the `dist` folder which
you can deploy wherever as a good ol' webpage.
